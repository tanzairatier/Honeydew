What is a Todo List:
    - A list of "todo items"
    - Each todo item is a title, description, assignee, due date, completed date

Why a Todo List:
    - Ultimately all about getting stuff done
	- Track who should do things, and when they were done, and when they should be done
	- Provides "audit" log historical records for later review
	- Motivates some people, the "completionists", into completing lists of things
	- Aid in prioritization when plate is full

Who a Todo List is for:
    - Virtually anyone really, but some groups of people might benefit more
	- As "Honeydew/honey-do", meant specifically to target husband and wife household duo's and families
	- In general, People who have lots of items to do
	- People who struggle to get their stuff done, and who might benefit from reduced clutter/stress and increased organization
	- For groups of people, like small contractor teams, the local plumber, your propane guy, e.g., small teams
	- Larger teams likely benefit from more sophisticated tools, e.g. Azure DevOps, Jira, Trello
	- This Todo List is meant to be simple, straight to the meat, straight to the heart of small-ops, black and white notepad style

Where/How:
    - This TodoList is meant to be online-hosted, as a simple web platform
	- Has a sophisticated back-end, mimicking larger web application platforms, as a proof of concept rather than for reasons intrinsic to the todo-list itself
	- SqlLite for database storage of todo's and a web ui to enable users to add, update, track and delete todo's
	- Some simple bells and whistles such as reminder notifications such as an auto-email system
